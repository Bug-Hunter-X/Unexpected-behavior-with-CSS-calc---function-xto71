The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it fails to calculate correctly if there are spaces around the operators. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not work as expected.  Another common mistake is forgetting to specify units with the numeric values in the calculation; for example, `calc(100% - 20)` is invalid.
